I'm a software developer, dipping my toes in web development for the first time. Front-end is difficult, I'll tell you that. if you have experience in this and want to give me some pointers feel free to find me on Twitter @marques93_ lol. I bet you could find every anti-pattern possible in here. Amazingly it still works somehow.</p>
